# What is this?
This project streamlines the connection between GitHub and user projects. It allows users without experience in git to easily operate, create, and reference repositories.

# Reference Libraries
This application requires the use of two external reference libraries, [GitSubprocessesClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitSubprocessClient?tab=readme-ov-file) and [GitHubApiClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitHubApiClient). Download the latest .jar files and open them in the cloned project folder.
